# Hotel Management Networking Project

This is a hands-on network design project for a hotel management system, created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project focuses on VLAN segmentation, routing, wireless configuration, and departmental structure to simulate a real-world hotel environment.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routers & Switches (Cisco 2911, 2960)
- VLAN Configuration
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- Wireless Access Points (Access Point PT)
- End Devices: PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, Tablets, Printers
- IP Addressing (Static & Dynamic)

##  Departments & VLANs

- HR Department — VLAN 40
- Finance — VLAN 50
- Sales — VLAN 30  
- Admin — VLAN 20  
- Logistics — VLAN 60  
- Store — VLAN 70  
- Reception — VLAN 80
